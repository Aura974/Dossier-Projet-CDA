**Keep This** is a simple and fast note-taking app that makes capturing and organizing your thoughts easy.
The app has a clean, user-friendly design, so you can quickly jot down ideas, reminders, or anything else you need to remember. 
It's perfect for meetings, brainstorming sessions, or everyday notes.
The focus is on making note-taking as effortless as possible, so you can spend more time being productive.

One of the standout features of **Keep This** is its social functionality. You can add friends to your friends list and share notes with them.
Whether you're working on a project together, sharing a shopping list, or helping each other study, you can easily share notes anytime, anywhere.
This feature makes collaborating and staying connected with friends or colleagues much easier. 
If you no longer need to share a note, you can unshare it whenever you want, giving you full control over your shared content.

**Keep This** also offers a great way to keep track of changes to your notes.
If you make a change and want to go back to a previous version, you can access the last three versions of each note. 
This ensures you don't lose important information and can easily revert to earlier versions when needed. 
This version control feature provides a safety net for your notes, allowing you to experiment and adjust without worry.

Additionally, you can organize your notes into different notebooks, making it simple to find what you need. 
This organization feature helps you categorize your notes in a way that makes sense to you, whether by project, topic, or any other method you prefer. 
**Keep This** is a handy tool that combines easy note-taking with useful sharing and organizing features, making it perfect for both personal and professional use.
